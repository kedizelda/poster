in our previous class i mentioned trying to make the letters look like some type of architecure; like a castle or a tower. i went for that with the poster and i believe i did a good job, it also resembles a long candle which i thought was fitting because i wanted to give a spooky flicker animation to my letters anyway. they flicker on hover.

i had a little bit of an issue with the letters r and c, their right half are covered by the letters to their right and i meant to fix that, but when i rearranged them in html they all shifted and it seemed like it would take too long to correct, so i left it as is. their left side still runs the animation.

the poster is stuck to the left because when i centered the elements it messed up my letters a lot and i couldn't fix it, but it works fine on mobile anyway.
